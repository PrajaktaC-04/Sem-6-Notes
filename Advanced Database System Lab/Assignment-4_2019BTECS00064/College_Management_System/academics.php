							 It gives me a sense of happiness and pride to introduce my department’s profile in the year 2021-2022. With a strong commitment we keep marching towards vision and missions of our department and institute as a whole. This is yet another year which showcased the rich tradition of department on the fronts of academics, research, consultancy, industry-institute interactions and student’s empowerment. Industry-Institute interaction is key focus area which helps us enrich our academic programmes and keep them up to date and relevant. Industry professionals were invited to guide and advice students on many occasions. Core UG and two PG programmes are strengthened by eminent industry experts through various MoU’s and up to date curriculum that matches the expectations of industry to a great extent. Recently the third year UG and second year PG programme curriculum were updated as per BoS suggestions which are in tune with the modern AICTE guidelines. Interaction with industry has made the UG and PG streams highly relevant in civil engineering and allied fields. Since its inception in India, department has been continuously engaged in improving its standards in the much sought after OBE philosophy all over the world.

							We keep deep faith in providing opportunities to our students to learn and develop themselves beyond the conventional classroom. Many student-centric training workshops, technology oriented industry supported projects, internship programmes provide such opportunities. Several such endeavors imparted knowledge beyond curriculum and added personality development traits among students. They are also encouraged and motivated to compete in several academic and professional competitions resulting in many achievements such as conferences, workshops, seminars and online courses etc. All such efforts enabled students to appear for all campus placements with a professional competence and confidence. This also could generate enormous interest for students of these programmes to appear for competitive examinations such as GATE and public service examinations.

							Significant developments could be witnessed in research and consultancy this year. The departmental highly competent faculty and staff are working out an extra mile to serve the state govt. in getting their important projects audited and approved in time. Many industries are benefitted by expert advice from faculty to enhance their systems and get their audit/approval certificates. The research publications by faculty in international, national journals and conferences show encouraging trend.

							Faculty and staff has been encouraged, and widely supported by TEQIP-III activities, to update and up skill themselves. Many of the faculty has been benefitted by latest technology workshops and FDP through this channel. Several faculties also took NPTEL and other such professional MOOC courses enthusiastically with promising results. Our department also served as partner and mentor to Jabalpur College of Engineering to collaboratively enhance the teaching-learning system and enrich them mutual know how.

							This year brought us opportunity to realize our strengths once again in the time of crisis. District of Sangli witnessed disaster of its kind in the event of extraordinary flood that devastated many properties and took many lives. In such a tough time our students and faculty stood by Nobel cause and helped the society. We really feel proud to share those moments when district collector praised our services and bestowed govt. appreciation letter to us. Once again, in the second semester of A.Y.2019-2020 the whole world saw the crisis of pandemic COVID-19; and the department could again have stood by for student’s benefit. With all odds the department was able to complete the online teaching and assessment successfully with in targeted duration by which I am sure, our all students must be having been relieved from great anxiety and pressures.

							I express my sincere thanks to faculty and staff for their sustained efforts and enthusiastic cooperation in building the performance, and achieving significant growth of the department. I am confident that we can certainly meet the challenges of future with the team spirit and support from the motivated people of the department. I thank reader for his/her interest in going through the shared thoughts.
